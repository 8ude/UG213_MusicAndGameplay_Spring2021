### Assignment 4: Rhythm Game Prototype 1 (Due Sunday Mar 7 at 11:59 pm Eastern)

Designing/coding rhythm games can a bit trickier than sound toys - we need to deal with a fixed timeline and more precise gameplay.  For that reason, I'm not expecting much more than new music and a new beatmap for this first week, but be asking yourself: what would your ideal version of this game look, feel, and control like? 

At the minimum, draft a new audio track and create a beatmap.  [Here's a video on how to do this in Wwise.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SHUSfQ_lohI43cNPexuNy0EMBf6Jhr6u/view?usp=sharing)

Feel free to dig more into the code, make more drastic revisions, and change the visuals, to the extent that you have time this week. 

When you're done, be sure to upload both Windows and Mac builds to itch (WebGL won't work)

### Assignment 3: Sound Toy Protoype 2 (Due Sunday Feb 28 at Noon Eastern)

NOTE THE CHANGE IN DUE DATE

You can either expand on your original sound toy prototype, or go off in a different direction. If you choose the latter, I recommend experimenting with synthesis and rhythm in Unity.  If you focused on sound last time, maybe focus on visual theming this time around.


### Reading (By Feb 22nd)

[Ableton - Learning Synthesis (up through "filters")](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/synth-basics/changing-the-sound)

[Ableton - Learning Music (up to "basslines")](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/)

If music/synthesis is new for you, just focus on getting used to the vocabulary and building an intuition for what words like "lowpass filter" and "major scale" mean.

If you are well versed in these subjects, think about what this material is leaving out, what assumptions it's making, and how that informs the kinds of interfaces that are used.

### Assignment 2: Sound Toy Prototype 1 (Due Wednesday Feb 17 at Noon Eastern)

Working alone or in pairs, make a sound toy prototype.  You can either make a mod of the example project or start from scratch. Working in Unity is preferred.

At the least, put your own sounds into the Sound Toy.  Think about visual improvements - this could be some kind of theming or just more visual juice.

Uploads to itch.io are preferred, if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the slack or discord.



### Assignment 1: Music Game Critical Play

Working alone or in pairs, choose a game from the following list, and a date to give a 5-minute presentation on it:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xssujtcdjp12RDrPY6mqctlglCMFGsxV-Vy-iil-0RI/edit?usp=sharing

Ideally, you should play the game (it can be on an emulator if you can find one) for 2-3 hours, instead of watching a let's play.  Try to pick something you haven't played before.

As part of your presentation, make sure to touch on the following things:

* What's the primary experience aim of the game?  Does it want you to feel like a rock star, or feel like you're composing music?

* If it's a Rhythm Game, how is the timing communicaed?  Through animations?  A "note highway"?  If it's a note highway, how is that highway represented (2D, 3D, etc?)

* If it's a Sound Toy, what kind of music mapping is taking place?  That is, what parts of the game (physics, motion, screen coordinates) are being mapped on to things like pitch, volume and timbre?  Is it a potential performance tool, instrument, or more suited to solo play?  Why?

* If it's a hybrid/synesthetic game, what genres is it drawing from, and how is it making this gameplay "musical"?  How much of the music is pre-composed, vs generated based on player interaction?

* If you can find any information on the development of the game, be sure to reference that as well!
