Itch.io is preferred for uploading assignments; if that doesn't work for any reason you can always [drop them here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y29kA2MScYa_VtVYYSdVY5pU5G8ttM7j?usp=sharing)

### Assignment 6: Music-ify a Game (Due Sunday April 11 at noon)

Take an existing game (I have two example games for you to choose from - [Block Dog](https://github.com/8ude/UG213_MusicAndGameplay_Spring2021/tree/main/BlockDog) and [Tour](https://github.com/8ude/UG213_MusicAndGameplay_Spring2021/tree/main/Tour) ) and make it musical!  

This is an open ended assignment that invites you to experiment with what a "music game" can be, and how connecting musical layers to gameplay can change an experience.

The minimum for this assignment is to replace the sound - it can be as active or as minimal as you choose. Both Projects have an Audio Director game object (this is called Audio Manager in Tour) where all the sound effects and musical loops live.  You're free to change whatever you'd like in the code and visuals as well.

When you're done, make a build and post it to itch (be sure to credit the original creator - Gabe Cuzzillo for Block Dog or Hang Ruan for Tour).  If you can't post to itch, upload a build [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O7WtNXAtBMtJuk5FfoMsSs6I-RAoPmel?usp=sharing) 

### Midterm Assignment: (Due Sunday April 4 at Noon Eastern)

Working alone or in groups of 2-3, make a music game proof of concept (basically a more evolved prototype). You can use one of your prototypes as a starting point, if you wish, but I encourage you to branch out or start over with a new concept.

[Here's a link to a rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-0OPe9g5o-F4LFVjnSCuShDYxzpuY7RWMrSzagJq2E/edit?usp=sharing)

Post a link to your game in the class Discord - either on itch.io or through [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L6qY9uJ9o46hEq7Ucv_rLkNXBxcCwEqY?usp=sharing)

We will be doing a Check-In on March 29 that I will grade Pass/Partial/Fail, worth 20 points (20% of your midterm grade). Aim for something playable, but I'm mostly just looking for progress.  If you are absent that day, please upload some gameplay footage to the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A_LzMs15shKmtytZGon2AFiFfVxJLejo?usp=sharing)

### Assignment 5: Rhythm Game Prototype 2 (Due Sunday Mar 15 at noon Eastern)

Either take a second pass at your rhythm game (this could be designing a new level, or making a new feature), or try a different approach.  

I've uploaded a new template project which uses the same cue-action game loop as last week, but uses a different kind of cue.  Think about what you can do with the cue system of your game - it could be driven by animation, text, unity physics - try something unconventional. 

Once again, please upload Win and Mac builds as Wwise does not support WebGL

### Assignment 4: Rhythm Game Prototype 1 (Due Sunday Mar 14 at noon Eastern)

Designing/coding rhythm games can a bit trickier than sound toys - we need to deal with a fixed timeline and more precise gameplay.  For that reason, I'm not expecting much more than new music and a new beatmap for this first week, but be asking yourself: what would your ideal version of this game look, feel, and control like? 

At the minimum, draft a new audio track and create a beatmap.  [Here's a video on how to do this in Wwise.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SHUSfQ_lohI43cNPexuNy0EMBf6Jhr6u/view?usp=sharing)

Feel free to dig more into the code, make more drastic revisions, and change the visuals, to the extent that you have time this week. 

When you're done, be sure to upload both Windows and Mac builds to itch (WebGL won't work)

### Assignment 3: Sound Toy Protoype 2 (Due Sunday Feb 28 at Noon Eastern)

NOTE THE CHANGE IN DUE DATE

You can either expand on your original sound toy prototype, or go off in a different direction. If you choose the latter, I recommend experimenting with synthesis and rhythm in Unity.  If you focused on sound last time, maybe focus on visual theming this time around.


### Reading (By Feb 22nd)

[Ableton - Learning Synthesis (up through "filters")](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/synth-basics/changing-the-sound)

[Ableton - Learning Music (up to "basslines")](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/)

If music/synthesis is new for you, just focus on getting used to the vocabulary and building an intuition for what words like "lowpass filter" and "major scale" mean.

If you are well versed in these subjects, think about what this material is leaving out, what assumptions it's making, and how that informs the kinds of interfaces that are used.

### Assignment 2: Sound Toy Prototype 1 (Due Wednesday Feb 17 at Noon Eastern)

Working alone or in pairs, make a sound toy prototype.  You can either make a mod of the example project or start from scratch. Working in Unity is preferred.

At the least, put your own sounds into the Sound Toy.  Think about visual improvements - this could be some kind of theming or just more visual juice.

Uploads to itch.io are preferred, if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the slack or discord.



### Assignment 1: Music Game Critical Play

Working alone or in pairs, choose a game from the following list, and a date to give a 5-minute presentation on it:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xssujtcdjp12RDrPY6mqctlglCMFGsxV-Vy-iil-0RI/edit?usp=sharing

Ideally, you should play the game (it can be on an emulator if you can find one) for 2-3 hours, instead of watching a let's play.  Try to pick something you haven't played before.

As part of your presentation, make sure to touch on the following things:

* What's the primary experience aim of the game?  Does it want you to feel like a rock star, or feel like you're composing music?

* If it's a Rhythm Game, how is the timing communicaed?  Through animations?  A "note highway"?  If it's a note highway, how is that highway represented (2D, 3D, etc?)

* If it's a Sound Toy, what kind of music mapping is taking place?  That is, what parts of the game (physics, motion, screen coordinates) are being mapped on to things like pitch, volume and timbre?  Is it a potential performance tool, instrument, or more suited to solo play?  Why?

* If it's a hybrid/synesthetic game, what genres is it drawing from, and how is it making this gameplay "musical"?  How much of the music is pre-composed, vs generated based on player interaction?

* If you can find any information on the development of the game, be sure to reference that as well!
