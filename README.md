### Assignment 1: Music Game Critical Play

Working alone or in pairs, choose a game from the following list, and a date to give a 5-minute presentation on it:

Ideally, you should play the game (it can be on an emulator if you can find one) for 2-3 hours, instead of watching a let's play.  Try to pick something you haven't played before.

As part of your presentation, make sure to touch on the following things:

* What's the primary experience aim of the game?  Does it want you to feel like a rock star, or feel like you're composing music?

* If it's a Rhythm Game, how is the timing communicaed?  Through animations?  A "note highway"?  If it's a note highway, how is that highway represented (2D, 3D, etc?)

* If it's a Sound Toy, what kind of music mapping is taking place?  That is, what parts of the game (physics, motion, screen coordinates) are being mapped on to things like pitch, volume and timbre?  Is it a potential performance tool, instrument, or more suited to solo play?  Why?

* If it's a hybrid/synesthetic game, what genres is it drawing from, and how is it making this gameplay "musical"?  How much of the music is pre-composed, vs generated based on player interaction?

* If you can find any information on the development of the game, be sure to reference that as well!
